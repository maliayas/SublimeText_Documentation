Themes
The look of the Sublime Text interface is controlled by themes. The term theme refers strictly to the look of the UI – buttons, select lists, the sidebar, tabs and so forth. The highlighting of source code, markup and prose is controlled by a color scheme.
The theme engine for Sublime Text is based on raster graphics. PNGs are used to prevent texture degradation and provide full alpha control. Each element in the UI can have up to four layers of textures or fills applied, with properties to control opacity and padding. The properties set on each element can be conditionally changed based on user interaction and settings.
Sublime Text themes are implemented via the .sublime-theme format. It is a JSON format that specifies rules for matching elements and modifying their appearance.

Format
A .sublime-theme file contains a single JSON document. The document should be an object containing a key “rules” with the value of 3179 an array of rules. An optional key “variables” with an object containing variable/value pairs may be added. 3179
The following is an example of a .sublime-theme file, showing the format. A complete theme will have many more rules to cover all elements used in the UI.
[
// Set up the textures for a button
{
"class": "button_control",
"layer0.tint": "#000",
"layer0.opacity": 1.0,
"layer1.texture": "Theme - Example/textures/button_background.png",
"layer1.inner_margin": 4,
"layer1.opacity": 1.0,
"layer2.texture": "Theme - Example/textures/button_highlight.png",
"layer2.inner_margin": 4,

{
"class": "button_control",
"attributes": ["hover"],
"layer2.opacity": 1.0
},
// Basic text label style
{
"class": "label_control",
"fg": [240, 240, 240],
"font.bold": true
},
// Brighten labels contained in a button on hover
{
"class": "label_control",
"parents": [{"class": "button_control", "attributes": ["hover"]}],
"fg": [255, 255, 255]
}
]
Terminology
The primary contents of a theme is an array of rules. Each rule object contains a "class" key used to match to an element. In addition to the "class", matching can be further restricted by specifying "attributes", "settings", "parents" and "platforms" keys. Properties affect the look or behavior of the element.
Variables allow reusing values throughout different rules. Variables maycontain any type of syntax, but may only be referenced by top-level keys in a rule.
3179
Most elements have a single class name, although a few have more than one to allow for both generic, and specific styling. For example, the popup_control class can be used to set styles for the auto complete and HTML popups, however popup_control auto_complete_popup may be used to target just the auto complete popup. Multiple "class" values are separated by a space. When a rule specified multiple class names, all must be present on the element for the rule to be applied.
"attributes" are set by Sublime Text, and indicate the state of user interaction, or other information about the nature of an element. The value is an array of strings. Examples include "hover", "pressed" and "dirty".
"settings" uses values from .sublime-settings files to filter rules. This allowing theme authors to give users the ability to tweak a theme. Themes may define their own settings, but there are a handful of “default” settings that should be supported if possible. See Settings for more details.
The value for the "settings" key may be one of:
array of strings Each string is the name of boolean settings. To check for a false value, prefix the setting name with a !. Example: ["bold_folder_labels", "!always_show_minimap_viewport"].
object Each key is the name of a setting. A value may be a boolean, string, or array of strings. If an array of strings is used, the setting will be matched if any of the strings in the array matches the user’s value. When comparing to a string, the user’s setting will be coerced to an empty string when not set. Example: {"bold_folder_labels": true, "file_tab_style": "rounded"}.
The "parents" key is an array of objects specifying the "class" and "attributes" that must be matched in a parent element.
The "platforms" key is an array of strings specifying the what operating systems to apply the rule to. Valid options include "osx", "windows" and "linux".
Properties refer to all other keys in the JSON objects. Some properties are available on all elements, while others are specific to an individual element.
General Information
The follow sections discuss information about images and how to specify styles.
Specificity
Unlike CSS, a Sublime Text theme does not do specificity matching when applying rules to elements. All rules are tested, in order, against each element. Subsequent rules that match will override properties from previous rules.
Texture Images
All textures in a theme are specified using PNG images. Each texture should be saved at “normal” DPI, where each pixel in the file will be mapped to one device pixel. All file paths in the theme definition should reference the normal DPI version.
A second version of each texture should also be included at double the DPI, with &#64;2x added to the filename right before the extension. Sublime Text will automatically use the &#64;2x version when being displayed on a high-DPI screen. :since:<It is also possible to specify &#64;3x variants of textures for screens running at 300% scale or higher <3167>>.
SVG images are not currently supported.
Dimensions
Integer units in a theme referring to dimensions are always specified in device-independent pixels (DIP). Sublime Text automatically handles scaling UI elements based on the screen density.
Padding &amp; Margins
Padding and margin may be specified in one of three ways:
A single integer value – the same value is applied to the left, top, right and bottom
An array of two integers – the first value is applied to the left and right, while the second value is applied to the top and bottom
An array of four integers – the values are applied, in order, to the left, top, right and bottom
Inheritance
A theme may extend another theme, appending rules and overriding variables. To extend a theme, add a top-level key "extends" to the JSON object, with a string value of the base theme.
{
"extends": "Default.sublime-theme",
"rules":
[
{
"class": "label_control",
"parents": [{"class": "button_control", "attributes": ["hover"]}],
"fg": "red"
}
]
}
The resulting list of rules will start with the base theme rules followed by the extending theme rules. Any variables from the extending theme will override variables with the same name in the base theme. Variable overrides will affect rules both in the base theme and the extending theme.
3179
Variables
Reusable variables may be defined by a JSON object under the top-level key "variables". Variable names are strings, however the value may be a string, number, boolean, array or object. Using a variable requires specifying a string in the format var(example_variable_name).
{
"variables":
{
"light_gray": "rgb(240, 240, 240)"
},
"rules":
[
{
"class": "label_control",
"fg": "var(light_gray)"
}
]
}
Variables may be used as the value for any properties, but the variable must be the entire value, it may not be embedded within another variable. The only exception to this rule is that variables may be used as the base color for the CSS color() mod function.
3179
Colors
Colors may be specified by CSS or legacy color syntax:
CSS Color Syntax
Since Sublime Text build 3177, colors in themes may now be specified using CSS syntax, as supported by minihtml Reference. This includes support for hex, rgb(), hsl(), variables and the color mod function. Additionally, all Predefined Variables that are derived from the color scheme are available for use.
The color white, as hex
#fff
The color white, using rgb() functional notation
rgb(255, 255, 255)
50% opacity white, using hsl() functional notation
hsla(0, 100%, 100%, 0.5)
The closest color to red, as defined in the color scheme
var(--redish)
50% opacity of the closest color to red, as defined in the color scheme
color(var(--redish) a(0.5)
3179
Legacy Color Syntax
Prior to supporting CSS syntax for colors, themes were only able to specify colors using the following formats, which are now deprecated.
RGB
Colors in the RGB color space are specified via an array of 3 or 4 numbers, with the first three being integers ranging from 0 to 255 representing the components red, green and blue. The optional fourth number is a float ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 that controls the opacity of the color.
The color white, with full opacity
[255, 255, 255]
The color blue, with 50% opacity
[0, 0, 255, 0.5]
HSL
Colors may also be specified using the HSL color space by creating an array of 4 elements, with the first being the string "hsl". The second element is an integer from 0 to 360 specifying the hue. The third is an integer from 0 to 100 specifying the saturation, and the fourth is an integer from 0 to 100 specifying the lightness.
A dark magenta, with full opacity
["hsl", 325, 100, 30]
A float from 0.0 to 1.0 may be added as a fifth element to control the opacity.
A bright teal, with 50% opacity
["hsl", 180, 100, 75, 0.5]
Derived Colors
It is also possible to derive colors from the current global color scheme. Colors in this format are specified using arrays with specific formats. In all cases, the first element is the base color, which may be "foreground", "background" or "accent".
Change Opacity of Base Color
To change the opacity of a base color, specify an array of 2 elements, the first being the base color name and the second being a float from 0.0 to 1.0. The opacity will be set to the float value.
The color scheme foreground, at 90% opacity
["foreground", 0.9]
De-saturate Base Color
To de-saturate a base color, specify an array with 3 elements. The first is the name of the base color, the second is the string "grayscale", and the third is an integer from 0 to 100 which specifies what percentage of the saturation (in HSL color space) of the existing color should be retained. A value of 100 means no change, whereas a value of 0 would cause the color to be completely de-saturated.
The color scheme foreground, with the saturation adjusted to 1/4 of the original value.
["foreground", "grayscale", 25]
Tint Base Color
5 and 6-element derived colors allow blending a color into the base color. A 5-element colors uses an RGBA color, whereas a 6-element uses an HSLA. In both cases, the last element, which normally represents the opacity, controls how much of the secondary color is blended into the base.
The color scheme background, lightened with white
["background", 255, 255, 255, 0.1]
The color scheme accent, tinted with dark red
["accent", "hsl", 0, 100, 30, 0.2]
Colors derived from the color scheme will always be based on the global color scheme, and will not reflect view-specific color schemes. Certain view-specific controls in the UI have tinting properties that allow using the view-specific color scheme colors.
Font Sizes
Font sizes may be specified in the formats:
Numeric
An integer or float to specify the size of the font in pixels.
Examples: 12, 13.5.
CSS Format
A string of a px or rem CSS font size.
Examples: 12px, 1.`2rem
The rem size is based on the global setting font_size for most elements. Elements that use a different root font size will specify in the description.
4050
Attributes
Attributes are specified as an array of strings. Each string is an attribute name. To check for the absence of an attribute, prepend a ! to the name.
The following attributes are common to all elements:
hover
Set whenever the user’s mouse is hovered over an element.
Luminosity
Although not available on all elements, many have attributes set based on the approximate luminosity of the current color scheme. Most elements have the attributes set based on the global color scheme. Tabs and the tab background, however, have the attributes based on the color scheme specific to the selected view.
The attributes are assigned based on the V value of the background color, when represented as HSV colors.
file_light
V from 0.60-1.00
file_medium
V from 0.30-0.59
file_medium_dark
V from 0.10-0.29
file_dark
V from 0.00-0.09
Settings
Certain Sublime Text settings are design to influence the UI. Themes should respect these settings and change elements based on them.
"overlay_scroll_bars"
This should affect the style of the scroll bars – generally they should be semi-transparent and the overlay property of the scroll_area_control should be set to true.
"always_show_minimap_viewport"
If the current viewport area should be highlighted on the minimap even when the user is not hovering over the minimap.
"bold_folder_labels"
If folder names in the side bar should have the font.bold property set to true.
"mouse_wheel_switches_tabs"
This is used to control mouse wheel behavior of tabs on Linux. It should be combined with checking for !enable_tab_scrolling to change the mouse_wheel_switch property of the tabset_control to false.
"highlight_modified_tabs"
If the tabs of modified files should be highlighted. This setting should be checked in addition to the dirty attribute.
"show_tab_close_buttons"
If tabs should have close buttons.
"inactive_sheet_dimming"
4095
If sheets other than the one with the attribute highlighted should be visually de-emphasized using background_modifier.
Properties
The "rules" key of a .sublime-theme file is a JSON array of of objects describing how UI elements should be styled. Every element in the UI supports the following keys:
layer0.*
The bottom-most texture layer for the element.
layer1.*
The second texture layer for the element.
layer2.*
The third texture layer for the element.
layer3.*
The fourth texture layer for the element.
hit_test_level
A float value setting the required opacity of a pixel for a click to be considering a “hit”.
Layer Properties
Every element in the UI supports up to four texture layers for displaying fill colors and raster graphics. Each layer has dotted sub-keys in the format layer#.sub-key. Valid sub-keys include:
layer#.opacity
A float value from 0.0 to 1.0 that controls the master opacity of the layer.
Example: 0.9
layer#.tint
A color value of a fill color to apply to the layer.
Example: [255, 0, 0, 127]
layer#.texture
A string of the file path to a PNG image, relative to the Packages/ folder.
Example: "Theme - Default/arrow_right.png"
layer#.inner_margin
Texture images are stretched to fit the element by slicing into a grid of 9 using four lines. See padding &amp; margins for valid formats with which to specify the margin used to make the slices.
Example: [5, 2, 5, 2]
layer#.draw_center
A boolean that controls if the center rectangle of the 9-grid created via layer#.inner_margin should be drawn. This is an optimization that allows skipping an unused section of texture.
Example: false
layer#.repeat
A boolean that controls if the texture should be repeated instead of stretched.
Example: false
Value Animation
Properties specified by floats may be animated over time. Instead of providing a single numeric value, the animation is specified with an object including details of the animation. Value animation is primarily useful for changing opacity over time. The object keys are:
target
A float value from 0.0 to 1.0 that controls the destination value.
Example: 1.0
speed
A float value of 1.0 or greater that controls the relative length of time the animation takes.
Example: 1.5
interpolation
An optional string that allow specifying the use of smoothstep function instead of the default linear function.
Default: "linear"
Example: "smoothstep"
Texture Animation
The layer#.texture sub-key may be an object to specify an animation based on two or more PNG images. The object keys are:
keyframes
An array of strings of the paths to PNG images, in order
Example: ["Theme - Default/spinner.png", "Theme - Default/spinner1.png"]
loop
An optional boolean that controls if the animation should repeat
Default: false
Example: true
frame_time
An optional float specifying how long each frame should be displayed. 1.0 represents 1 second.
Default: 0.0333 (30 fps)
Example: 0.0166 (60 fps)
Texture Tinting Properties
Certain elements have an available tint value set by the background of current color scheme. The tint can be modified and applied to a layer#.texture image.
tint_index
Controls which layer the tint is applied to. Must be an integer from 0 to 3.
tint_modifier
An array of four integers in the range 0 to 255. The first three are blended into the RGB values from the tint color with the fourth value specifying how much of these RGB modifier values to apply.
Font Properties
Certain textual elements allow setting the following font properties:
font.face
The name of the font face.
font.size
The font size.
font.bold
A boolean, if the font should be bold.
font.italic
A boolean, if the font should be italic.
color
A color value to use for the text - the fg property is an alias for this for backwards compatibility.
shadow_color
A color value to use for the text shadow.
shadow_offset
A 2-element array containing the X and Y offsets of the shadow
opacity
4073
A float from 0.0 to 1.0 that is multiplied against the opacity of the color and shadow_color properties.
Filter Label Properties
Labels used in the quick panel have color control based on selection and matching:
fg
A color value for unselected, unmatched text.
match_fg
A color value for unselected, matched text.
bg
A color value for the background of an unselected row.
selected_fg

Row-based tables of data provide the following properties:
dark_content
If the background is dark – used to set the dark attribute for scrollbars.
row_padding
Padding added to each row, in one of the formats described in padding &amp; margins.
Styled Label Properties
Certain labels allow for additional control over their appearance. They support the properties:
border_color
A color value for the border of the label.
background_color
A color value for the background of the label.

Customization
Users can customize a theme by creating a file with new rules that will be appended to the original theme definition.
To create a user-specific customization of a theme, create a new file with the same filename as the theme, but save it in the Packages/User/ directory.
For example, to customize the Default theme, create a file named Packages/User/Default.sublime-theme. Adding the following rules to that file will increase the size of the text in the sidebar.
