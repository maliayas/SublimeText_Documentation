Indentation Settings
Indentation settings determine the size of the tab stops, and control whether the Tab key should insert tabs or spaces. In addition to the automatic detection, they can be customized globally, per-syntax type, or per-file.
Basic Settings
Indentation Detection
Converting Between Tabs and Spaces
Automatic Indentation Settings
Basic Settings
tab_size
integer
The number of spaces a tab is considered equal to
translate_tabs_to_spaces
boolean
If true, spaces will be inserted up to the next tab stop when Tab is pressed, rather than inserting a tab character
detect_indentation
boolean
If true, the default, tab_size and translate_tabs_to_spaces will be calculated automatically when loading a file
use_tab_stops
boolean
If translate_tabs_to_spaces is true, use_tab_stops will make Tab insert, and Backspace delete, up to the next tab stop
See Settings for information about how to set global and syntax-specific settings.
Indentation Detection
When a file is loaded, its contents are examined, and the tab_size and translate_tabs_to_spaces settings are set for that file. The status area will report when this happens. While this generally works well, you may want to disable it. You can do that with the detect_indentation setting.
Indentation detection can be run manually via the View  Indentation  Guess Settings From Buffer menu, which runs the detect_indentation command.
Converting Between Tabs and Spaces
The View  Indentation menu has commands to convert leading whitespace in the current file between tabs and spaces. These menu items run the expand_tabs and unexpand_tabs commands.
Automatic Indentation Settings
Automatic indentation guesses the amount of leading whitespace to insert on each line when you press enter. It's controlled with these settings:
auto_indent
boolean
Enables auto indent
Default:
true
smart_indent
boolean
Makes auto indent a little smarter, e.g., by indenting the next line after an if statement in C.
Default:
true
trim_automatic_white_space
boolean
Trims white space added by auto_indent when moving the caret off the line.
Default:
true
indent_to_bracket
boolean
Adds whitespace up to the first open bracket when indenting. Use when indenting like this:
use_indent_to_bracket(to_indent,
like_this);
Default:
false
