Color Schemes
The highlighting of source code and prose in Sublime Text is controlled by a color scheme. A color scheme assigns colors and font styles to scopes, which are assigned to the text by the syntax. The rest of the look of the user interface is controlled by the theme. The theme controls such elements as buttons select lists, the sidebar and tabs.
Sublime Text color schemes are implemented using .sublime-color-scheme files, containing JSON. Sublime Text also supports a subset of features using the TextMate .tmTheme format. Before Sublime Text 3.1, only the .tmTheme format was supported.

Example
The following is an example of the format of a .sublime-color-scheme file. A complete color scheme will have many more rules to cover the standard scope names.
{
"name": "Example Color Scheme",
"globals":
{
"background": "rgb(34, 34, 34)",
"foreground": "#EEEEEE",
"caret": "white"
},
"rules":
[
{
"name": "Comment",
"scope": "comment",
"foreground": "#888888"
},
{
"name": "String",
"scope": "string",
"foreground": "hsla(50, 100%, 50%, 1)",
},
{
"name": "Number",
"scope": "constant.numeric",
"foreground": "#7F00FF",
"font_style": "italic",
}
]
}
Colors
Colors in color schemes may be specified using one of seven formats:
Hex RGB: A # followed by six hex characters, with the first two specifying the red channel, second tow the green channel and the final two the blue channel. Red is written as #FF0000. An abbreviated form is available when each of the three pairs use the same value for both characters. Red is written as #F00.
Hex RGBA: Same as Hex RGBA, but with an extra pair of hex characters at the end to specify the alpha channel. Red with 67% opacity is written as #FF0000AA. The abbreviated form would be #F00A.
RGB functional notation: A function named rgb that accepts three integers in the range 0 to 255. The first integer specifies the red channel, the second the green channel and the third the blue channel. Red is written as rgb(255, 0, 0).
RGBA functional notation: Identical to the RGB function format, except the name of the function is rgba and a fourth parameter is added accepting a value from 0.0 to 1.0 specifying the alpha channel. Red with 50% opacity is written as rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5).
HSL functional notation: A function named hsl that accepts three values. The first is an integer in the range 0 to 360 specifying the hue. The second is a percentage specifying the saturation. The third is a percentage specifying the lightness. Red is written as hsl(0, 100%, 50%).
HSLA functional notation: Identical to the HSL function format, except the name of the function is hsla and a fourth parameter is added accepting a value from 0.0 to 1.0 specifying the alpha channel. Red with 50% opacity is written as hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5).
HWB functional notation: A function named hwb that accepts three or four values. The first is an integer in the range 0 to 360 specifying the hue. The second is a percentage specifying the percentage of white mixed in. The third is a percentage specifying the black mixed in. The optional fourth parameter is a value from 0.0 to 1.0 that controls the opacity. Examples include: hwb(0, 20%, 20%) and hwb(0, 20%, 20%, 0.5). 3181
Named: CSS color names. Please note that while some share names with X11 named colors used in .tmTheme files, the actual colors tend to differ.
Additionally, colors may be specified as a variable, and then referenced via the syntax var(example_var_name). Variable references are particularly useful when combined with the minihtml Colors and the supported blend(), blenda(), alpha(), saturation(), lightness() and min-contrast() adjusters.
blend() adjuster: Blends a color into the base. To blend equal parts grey and a base color referenced via variable, in RGB space: color(var (base_green) blend(#888 50%)). If colors should be blended in HSL space, use the following form: color(var(base_green) blend(#888 50% hsl)). The resulting alpha value is always the alpha channel of the base color.
blenda() adjuster: Functions the same way as the blend() adjuster, but blends the alpha channel of the two colors instead of just using the alpha channel from the base. An example of the blending a partially transparent grey into a green: color(var(base_green) blenda(#8888 50% hsl))
alpha() adjuster: Changes the alpha channel of the base color to the value specified, from 0.0 to 1.0. Setting the alpha channel to 90%: color(var(base_green) alpha(0.9)). A shorthand name of a() is also available for this adjuster.
saturation() adjuster: Changes the saturation channel of the base color, in the HSL color space, to the value specified, from 0% to 100%. Setting the saturation to 90%: color(var (base_green) saturation(0.9)). Increasing the saturation by 10%: color(var(base_green) s(+ 10%)). A shorthand name of s() is also available for this adjuster. 3179
lightness() adjuster: Changes the lightness channel of the base color, in the HSL color space, to the value specified, from 0%` to 100%. Setting the lightness to 90%: color(var (base_green) lightness(0.9)). Decreasing the lightness by 10%: color (var(base_green) l(- 10%)). A shorthand name of l() is also available for this adjuster. 3179
min-contrast() adjuster (Proprietary: Modifies a color to ensure a minimum contrast ratio against a “background” color. The first parameter is the color to calculate the contrast again, the “background”, and the second is a decimal number specifying the minimum contrast ratio. Typical values for the contrast ratio range from 2.0 to 4.5. Ensure a contrast ratio of 2.5 against the background: color(var (base_green) min-contrast(var(bg_color) 2.5)) 3181
Variables
Reusable color definitions may be created in the variables key. The names may be any string utilizing the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ and -. The values may be any valid color format.
Variables may be referenced in the global settings and rules, via the syntax var(example_var_name). The following example shows basic variable usage:

Shadows
"shadow"
The color of the shadow used to show when a text area can be horizontally scrolled.
"shadow_width"
The width of the shadow in device-independent pixels.
Scope Rules
Color schemes interact with the text in a file via scopes. Scopes are set to code or prose tokens via the syntax. Scopes are dotted strings, specified from least-to-most specific. For example, the if keyword in PHP could be specified via the scope name keyword.control.php.
Matching
Color schemes apply colors and font styles to the scopes by matching the dotted labels, starting with the first. Prefix matching is the standard way to have a color scheme apply to multiple syntaxes. Instead of matching keyword.control.php, most color schemes will instead assign a color to keyword. Matching the first one or two labels in a scope is most common. Including the final label, the syntax name, is uncommon unless a syntax-specific override is desired.
Naming
Author of syntaxes can assign whatever scopes they want to a given token. This combined with the fact that there are hundreds of community-maintained syntaxes means that is can be hard to know what scopes to target. The Scope Naming were established to help syntax and color scheme authors use a common set, for better interoperability. The Color Schemes section provides a baseline set of scopes that color scheme authors should strive to handle.
Style Rules
Each scope style rule consists of an object containing "scope" key, along with one or more of the following optional keys:
"name"
The (arbitrary) name for the scope rule.
"foreground"
The text color.
"background"
The background color.
"foreground_adjust"
3179
An adjustment to the "foreground" color, only valid with "background".
"selection_foreground"
The text color when selected.
"font_style"
Zero or more of the following, separated by spaces:
bold
italic
glow 4050
underline 4074
stippled_underline 4075
squiggly_underline 4075
The "foreground_adjust" key accepts a space-separated list of adjusters that are supported by the minihtml Color. It is only supported when the "background" key is also specified, and thus allows modifying all foregrounds used in combination with the background, without having to create different rules for every permutation.
Hashed Syntax Highlighting
The "foreground" key supports a special mode called Hashed Syntax Highlighting, where each token matching the scope specified will receive a unique color from one, or more, gradients. Some editors refer to this style of highlighting as Semantic Highlighting.
To use hashed syntax highlighting, the "foreground" key must have a value that is an array of two or more colors. Sublime Text will create 256 different colors that are linear interpolations(lerp) between the colors provided. The interpolation is done in HSL space.
As Sublime Text highlights the tokens in a file, it will create a hashed value of the token, and use that to pick one of the 256 linear interpolations. Every instance of a given token will use the same color. For instance, each instance of first_name would have the same color, but every instance of name would have a different color.
For hashed syntax highlighting to be most obvious, the hue difference between the start and end points should be as far apart as possible. Here is an example of using blues, purples and pinks for variable names:
{
"scope": "source - punctuation - keyword",
"foreground": ["hsl(200, 60%, 70%)", "hsl(330, 60%, 70%)"]
}
Examples
The following scope style rule will color all strings as green:
{
"name": "Strings",
"scope": "string",
"foreground": "#00FF00"
}
To style all numbers as bold, italic red, use:
{
"name": "Numbers",
"scope": "constant.numeric",
"foreground": "#FF0000",
"font_style": "bold italic"
}
Customization
Color schemes based on the .sublime-color-scheme format are specified by filename only, not a package-based file path. This allows users to customize a color scheme by overriding variables or globals, and adding rules.
To create a user-specific customization of a color scheme, create a new file with the same filename as the color scheme, but save it in the Packages/User/ directory.
For example, to customize the default Monokai color scheme, create a file named Packages/User/Monokai.sublime-color-scheme. The following settings will change the background color to be a fully-desaturated grey, the yellow to be more vibrant, and will add a new rule change Python docstrings to be colored the same as strings.
{
"variables":
{
"yellow": "hsl(54, 100%, 50%)",
},
"globals":
{
"background": "hsl(70, 0%, 15%)",
},
"rules":
[
{
"name": "Python docstrings",
"scope": "comment.block.documentation.python",
"foreground": "var(yellow)"
},
]
}
The contents of the "variables" and "globals" keys are merged, with the user’s copy overwriting keys with the same name. For the "rules" array, the user’s rules are appended.
