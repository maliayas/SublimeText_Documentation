File Patterns
Various features in Sublime Text use file patterns. These patterns are used to match against file/directory names and paths. They are similar in functionality to shell glob patterns, but have some unique behavior.

Basic Syntax
File patterns allow two matching operators:
*: matches zero or more characters, except /
?: matches exactly one character, except /
Neither character classes, [abc], nor the globstar operator, **, from Bash are supported.
Examples
The pattern abc will match abc but not abcd
The pattern a?c will match abc but not ac
The pattern a*c will match abc, ac and abdc
Path Rules
When / is not present in a pattern, it is only compared against the file or directory name and only the basic syntax applies. When a / is included in a pattern, it changes the behavior to:
The pattern is matched against the entire file or directory path
In a */ prefix or /* suffix, the * will match / characters
*/ will be implicitly prefixed if the pattern does not start with a / or *
* will be implicitly suffixed if the pattern does not start with a / or * <4066
If the pattern ends in / it will be treated as a directory pattern, and will match both a directory with that name and 4066 any contained files or subdirectories
If a pattern begins with a single /, it will be compared as an absolute path
If pattern begins with //, it will be compared as a relative path from the project root 4066
Examples
The pattern mydir/one will match /parent/mydir/one, /mydir/one and /mydir/one/sub
The pattern mydir/two will match /parent/mydir/two and /parent/mydir/two_sub <4066
The pattern mydir/two will match /parent/mydir/two but not /parent/mydir/two_sub 4066
The pattern /mydir/three will match /mydir/three but not /nested/mydir/three
The pattern mydir/three/ will match /parent/mydir/three/sub but not /parent/mydir/three <4066
The pattern mydir/four/ will match /parent/mydir/four and /parent/mydir/four/sub 4066
The pattern //mydir/five will match /project1/mydir/five and /project2/mydir/five but not /project1/nested/mydir/five 4066
