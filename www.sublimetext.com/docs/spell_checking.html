Spell Checking
Sublime Text uses Hunspell for its spell checking support. Additional dictionaries can be obtained from the OpenOffice.org Extension List.
Dictionaries in a format ready to be used by Sublime Text are available at https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries.

Dictionaries
Sublime Text currently only supports UTF-8 encoded dictionaries. Most dictionaries are not encoded in UTF-8, instead using a more compact encoding for the language in question. To use a dictionary with Sublime Text, it'll first need to be converted into UTF-8.
Once you have a UTF-8 encoded dictionary, it can be installed by placing it in a package, for example, Packages/User/, which you can access from the Preferences  Browse Packages menu item. Once the file is in place, you can select the dictionary from the View  Dictionary menu.
Settings
There are two settings that effect the spell checking: spell_check, which controls if spell checking is enabled, and dictionary, which gives the path to the dictionary file to use. For example:
spell_check
boolean
If spell checking is enabled
Default:
false
dictionary
string
The package-relative path to the dictionary file
Default:
"Packages/Language - English/en_US.dic"
added_words
array of strings
An array of properly spelled words to augment the dictionary with
Example:
["unobscurable"]
ignored_words
array of strings
An array of words to ignore when checking spelling
Example:
["revelationary"]
Commands
next_misspelling: Select the next misspelling
prev_misspelling: Select the previous misspelling
add_word: Adds the word given by the word argument to the add list
ignore_word: Adds the word given by the word argument to the ignore list
