minihtml Reference
Sublime Text contains a custom HTML and CSS engine, named minihtml, for displaying stylized content in editor panes. HTML content can be displayed in both popup windows and phantoms.
minihtml provides a limited subset of HTML and CSS features found in most web browsers. While only certain CSS and HTML features may be implemented, they are designed to be standards compliant. Any feature implemented should function the same way in minihtml as in a browser.

Tags
The following tags are styled by the default style sheet:
<html>
<head>, <style>
<body>
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
<div>
<p>
<ul>, <ol>, <li>
<b>, <strong>
<i>, <em>
<u>
<big>, <small>
<a>
<code>, <var>, <tt>
Special behavior is implemented for a few tags:
<a> — a callback can be specified via the API to handle clicks on anchor tags.
<img> — supports PNG, JPG and GIF images from file://, res:// and data: URLs.
<ul> — bullets are displayed for <li> tags.
Other HTML tags with special behavior are not implemented. This includes tags such as <input>, <button>, <table>, etc.
Attributes
The following attributes are supported:
class — for CSS selectors
id — for CSS selectors
style — inline CSS
href — callback-based navigation, protocols support 4073
title — tooltips 4085
Protocols
In HTML sheets, popups, annotations and completion item details, the href="" attribute of <a> tags automatically supports three protocols:
http: — standard URL, will use system default browser to open
https: — standard URL, will use system default browser to open
subl: — a command name and args to invoke a command
Valid subl: URL formats include:
subl:command_name
subl:command_name {"arg_name": arg_value, …}
For popups and annotations it is possible to define an on_navigate callback via the API that will be called for any URL except for the subl: protocol. This API-based approach was the only way to handle URLs before build 4073.

Inline Formatting
In the details field of completion items, quick panel items and list input items, there is support for a limited, inline formatting subset of minihtml. This allows for some basic text formatting, that respects the theme and color scheme the user has selected.
The supported tags are:
<a href=""> – protocols
<b>
<strong>
<i>
<em>
<u>
<tt>
<code>

Best Practices
To allow color scheme authors to tweak the look of popups and phantoms, it is best to add a unique id="" attribute to the <body> tag of your plugin’s HTML.
Within the <body> tag, add a <style> tag containing selectors that do not use the id. Leave that for selectors in color schemes to be able to override the plugin.
<body id="my-plugin-feature">
<style>
div.error {
background-color: red;
padding: 5px;
}
</style>
<div class="error"></div>
</body>
Predefined Classes
When minihtml processes the HTML markup, it will automatically add a single class name to the <html> tag. The class name will be dark or light, and is designed to allow for advanced use of CSS in styling phantoms and popups.
Which class is added is based on the lightness, in the HSL color space, of the background color of the current color scheme. If the lightness is less than 0.5, dark will be added. If the lightness is greater than or equal to 0.5, light will be added.

The following list provides an overview of supported properties and values:
display: none, inline, block, list-item, inline-block 4085
margin: positive units

right: positive and negative units
bottom: positive and negative units
left: positive and negative units
background-color: colors
font-family: comma-separated list of font families
font-size: positive units
font-style: normal, italic
font-weight: normal, bold
line-height: positive units
text-decoration: none, underline
text-align: left, right, center 4085

Units
Supported units of measurement include:
rem
em
px
pt
rem units are recommended because they are based on the user’s font_size setting, and they will not cascade.
Colors
Colors may be specified via:
Named colors: white, tan, etc
Shorthand hex: #fff
Shorthand hex with alpha: #fff8
Full hex: #ffffff
Full hex with alpha: #ffffff80
RGB functional notation: rgb(255, 255, 255)
RGBA functional notation: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
HSL functional notation: hsl(0, 100%, 100%)
HSLA functional notation: hsla(0, 100%, 100%, 0.5)
HWB functional notation: hwb(0, 20%, 20%), hwb(0, 20%, 20%, 0.5) 3181
transparent
color() Mod Function (Proprietary)
Additionally, color values may be modified using the CSS Color Module Level 4 (05 July 2016) color-mod function with the following adjusters. Unfortunately in a later draft of CSS Color Module Level 4, the color-mod function was removed.
alpha()/a()
saturation()/s() 3179
lightness()/l() 3179
blend()
blenda()
min-contrast() (Proprietary) 3181
.error {
background-color: color(var(--background) alpha(0.25));
}
.error {
background-color: color(var(--background) blend(red 50%));
}
The color-mod function will be most useful in combination with variables.
min-contrast() Adjuster
The min-contrast() adjuster for the color() mod function is a non-standard addition that is custom to minihtml. At the time of implementation, the CSS Color Module Level 4 spec had a contrast() adjuster, but it only allowed taking a color and modifying it to provide contrast with itself, as opposed to taking a second color (typically a background) and making sure the foreground has sufficient contrast with the background.
min-contrast() accepts two parameters: a background color to measure the contrast against, and a minimum contrast ratio between the “base” color and the background color. The ratio will be a decimal number, typically between 2.0 and 4.5.
.error {
background-color: color(var(--redish) min-contrast(var(--background) 2.5));
}
Please see the documentation for the contrast() adjuster for details about how the contrast ratio is calculated and how the color is modified to meet it.
Variables
CSS variables are also supported using custom properties and the var() functional notation. Custom properties are those starting with --.
html {
--fg: #f00;
}
.error {
background-color: var(--fg);
}
The one limitation is that the var() notation can not be used for part of a multi-number value, such as padding or margin. With those aggregate properties, the var() notation must be used for the complete value.
Predefined Variables
When a color scheme is loaded, the background and foreground colors are set to CSS variables, along with the closest color found to a handful of basic colors. These are all set in an html { } rule set in the default CSS style sheet.
var(--background)
var(--foreground)
var(–accent) 3179
var(--redish)
var(--orangish)
var(--yellowish)
var(--greenish)
var(–cyanish) 3179
var(--bluish)
var(--purplish)
var(--pinkish)
The algorithm to pick the colors uses the HSL color space and uses several heuristics to try and pick colors that are suitable for foreground use. In the case that the automatic color selection is undesirable, color scheme authors may override the appropriate values with their own html { } rule set contained in the popupCss or phantomCss settings.
If a variable with one of the predefined names is set in the selected .sublime-color-scheme, that value will be used instead of trying to find a match from the colors used in the color scheme.
