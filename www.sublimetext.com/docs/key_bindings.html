Key Bindings
Key bindings in Sublime Text are defined by files ending in .sublime-keymap. Key bindings use JSON, with the top-level structure being an array. Each binding is a JSON object.
Example
Bindings  "keys" Key
"command" Key
"args" Key
"context" Key
User Bindings
Example
The following is an example of the format of a .sublime-keymap file.
[
{
"keys": ["super+ctrl+m"],
"command": "convert_syntax"
},
{
"keys": ["super+shift+9"],
"command": "set_layout",
"args":
{
"cols": [0.0, 0.33, 0.66, 1.0],
"rows": [0.0, 0.33, 0.66, 1.0],
"cells":
[
[0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 2, 1], [2, 0, 3, 1],
[0, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 3, 2],
[0, 2, 1, 3], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 3]
]
}
},
{
"keys": ["super+alt+up"],
"command": "noop",
"context":
[
{"key": "panel", "operand": "find"},
{"key": "panel_has_focus"},
]
}
]
Bindings
Each key binding requires two keys, "keys" and "command". To pass args to a command, the "args" key should be specified. To restrict a key binding to a specific situation, the "context" key must be included.
"keys" Key
The "keys" value must be an array of strings, where each string contains a key press, comprised of a key and any modifiers. When multiple key presses are present in the array, the command will only be invoked if the presses are performed in sequence.
A key binding for the Escape key
{
"keys": ["escape"],
"command": "noop"
}
A key binding for the key A with the modifier Ctrl
{
"keys": ["ctrl+a"],
"command": "noop"
}
Modifiers
The following modifiers may be combined with key names for each key press.
ctrl
control
alt
option - Mac
command - Mac
super - the Windows key on Windows and Linux, or ⌘ on Mac
primary - Ctrl on Windows and Linux, or ⌘ on Mac
Key Names
Key names are specified either by the (non-shifted) character printed on the key, or a key name:

"command" Key
The "command" key specifies the name of the command to execute when the key press(es) are detected. The command may be a built-in command, or a command implemented by a plugin.
{
"keys": ["ctrl+a"],
"command": "select_all"
}
Currently there is no compiled list of all built-in commands. The names of many commands can be found by looking at the Default ({PLATFORM_NAME}).sublime-keymap files in the Default/ package.
"args" Key
The arguments to send to the "command" key may be specified by a JSON object under the "args" key.
{
"keys": ["primary+shift+b"],
"command": "build",
"args": {"select": true}
}
"context" Key
To allow for key bindings that react differently based on the situation, the "context" key allows specifying one or more conditions that must evaluate to true for the key binding to be active.
The "context" value is an array of objects. Each object must contain a "key" key that has a string value. A key is one of a predefined list of values that may be compared using an "operator" and "operand".
If a "key" support equailty operators, the "operator" must be one of: "equal" or "not_equal". For matching it must be one of: "regex_match", "not_regex_match", "regex_contains" or "not_regex_contains". The default "operator" is "equal" and the default "operand" is true.
For "key" values that deal with selections, an additional key "match_all" is supported. This defaults to false, which means the condition only needs to evaluate to true for a single selection. If "match_all" is true, then the condition must evaluate to true for all selections.
The following is a list of valid context "key" values:

User Bindings
Users can customize their key bindings by creating a file named Default.sublime-keymap in their Packages/User/ directory.
For example, the following will create a key binding to show unsaved changes, if any exist, via Ctrl+Shift+`.
[
{
"keys": ["ctrl+shift+`"],
"command": "diff_changes"
}
]
