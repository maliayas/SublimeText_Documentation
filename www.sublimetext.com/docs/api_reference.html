General Information
Example Plugins
Several pre-made plugins come with Sublime Text, you can find them in the Default package:
Packages/Default/exec.py Uses phantoms to display errors inline
Packages/Default/font.py Shows how to work with settings
Packages/Default/goto_line.py Prompts the user for input, then updates the selection
Packages/Default/mark.py Uses add_regions() to add an icon to the gutter
Packages/Default/show_scope_name.py Uses a popup to show the scope names at the caret
Packages/Default/arithmetic.py Accepts an input from the user when run via the Command Palette
Plugin Lifecycle
At importing time, plugins may not call any API functions, with the exception of:
sublime.version()
sublime.platform()
sublime.arch()
sublime.channel()
sublime.executable_path() 4081
sublime.packages_path() 4081
sublime.installed_packages_path() 4081
sublime.cache_path() 4081
If a plugin defines a module level function plugin_loaded(), this will be called when the API is ready to use. Plugins may also define plugin_unloaded(), to get notified just before the plugin is unloaded.
Threading
All API functions are thread-safe, however keep in mind that from the perspective of code running in an alternate thread, application state will be changing while the code is running.
Units and Coordinates
API functions that accept or return coordinates or dimensions do so using device-independent pixel (dip) values. While in some cases these will be equivalent to device pixels, this is often not the case. Per the CSS specification, minihtml treats the px unit as device-independent.
Types
sublime.DIP = float
Represents a device-independent pixel position.
sublime.Vector = Tuple[DIP, DIP]
Represents a X and Y coordinate.
sublime.Point = int
Represents the offset from the beginning of the editor buffer.
sublime.Value = Union[bool, str, int, float, List[Value], Dict[str, Value]]
A JSON-equivalent value.
sublime.CommandArgs = Optional[Dict[str, Value]]
The arguments to a command may be None or a dict of str keys.
sublime.Kind = Tuple[KindId, str, str]
Metadata about the kind of a symbol, CompletionItem, QuickPanelItem or ListInputItem. Controls the color and letter shown in the “icon” presented to the left of the item.
sublime.Event = dict
Contains information about a user’s interaction with a menu, command palette selection, quick panel selection or HTML document. The follow methods are used to signal that an event dict is desired:
Commands may opt-in to receive an arg named event by implementing the method want_event(self) and returning True.
A call to show_quick_panel() may opt-in to receive a second arg to the on_done callback by specifying the flag QuickPanelFlags.WANT_EVENT. 4096
ListInputHandler classes may opt-in to receive a second arg to the validate() and confirm() methods by by implementing the method want_event() and returning True. 4096
The dict may contain zero or more of the following keys, based on the user interaction:
"x": float
The X mouse position when a user clicks on a menu, or in a minihtml document.
"y": float
The Y mouse position when a user clicks on a menu, or in a minihtml document.
"modifier_keys": dict
4096
Can have zero or more of the following keys:
"primary" - indicating Ctrl (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (Mac) was pressed
"ctrl" - indicating Ctrl was pressed
"alt" - indicating Alt was pressed
"altgr" - indicating AltGr was pressed (Linux only)
"shift" - indicating Shift was pressed
"super" - indicating Win (Windows/Linux) or Cmd (Mac) was pressed
Present when the user selects an item from a quick panel, selects an item from a ListInputHandler, or clicks a link in a minihtml document.
sublime.CompletionValue = Union[str, Tuple[str, str], CompletionItem]
Represents an available auto-completion item. completion values may be of several formats. The term trigger refers to the text matched against the user input, replacement is what is inserted into the view if the item is selected. An annotation is a unicode string hint displayed to the right-hand side of the trigger.
str: A string that is both the trigger and the replacement: [ "method1()", "method2()", ]  
2-element tuple or list: A pair of strings - the trigger and the replacement: [ ["me1", "method1()"], ["me2", "method2()"] ]   If a t is present in the trigger, all subsequent text is treated as an annotation: [ ["me1\tmethod", "method1()"], ["me2\tmethod", "method2()"] ]   The replacement text may contain dollar-numeric fields such as a snippet does, e.g. $0, $1: [ ["fn", "def ${1:name}($2) { $0 }"], ["for", "for ($1; $2; $3) { $0 }"] ]  
CompletionItem object An object containing trigger, replacement, annotation, and kind metadata: [ sublime.CompletionItem( "fn", annotation="def", completion="def ${1:name}($2) { $0 }", completion_format=sublime.COMPLETION_FORMAT_SNIPPET, kind=sublime.KIND_SNIPPET ), sublime.CompletionItem( "for", completion="for ($1; $2; $3) { $0 }", completion_format=sublime.COMPLETION_FORMAT_SNIPPET, kind=sublime.KIND_SNIPPET ), ]

on_query_context(key: str, operator: QueryOperator, operand: str, match_all: bool) &#x2192; Optional[bool]
Called when determining to trigger a key binding with the given context key. If the plugin knows how to respond to the context, it should return either True of False. If the context is unknown, it should return None.
Parameters
key
The context key to query. This generally refers to specific state held by a plugin.
operator
The operator to check against the operand; whether to check equality, inequality, etc.
operand
The value against which to check using the operator.
match_all
This should be used if the context relates to the selections: does every selection have to match (match_all == True), or is at least one matching enough (match_all == False)?

True or False if the plugin handles this context key and it either does or doesn’t match. If the context is unknown return None.

on_text_changed_async(changes: List[TextChange]):
Same as on_text_changed but runs in a separate thread, not blocking the application.
