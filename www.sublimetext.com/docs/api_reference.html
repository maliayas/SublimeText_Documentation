General Information
Example Plugins
Several pre-made plugins come with Sublime Text, you can find them in the Default package:
Packages/Default/exec.py Uses phantoms to display errors inline
Packages/Default/font.py Shows how to work with settings
Packages/Default/goto_line.py Prompts the user for input, then updates the selection
Packages/Default/mark.py Uses add_regions() to add an icon to the gutter
Packages/Default/show_scope_name.py Uses a popup to show the scope names at the caret
Packages/Default/arithmetic.py Accepts an input from the user when run via the Command Palette
Plugin Lifecycle
At importing time, plugins may not call any API functions, with the exception of:
sublime.version()
sublime.platform()
sublime.arch()
sublime.channel()
sublime.executable_path() 4081
sublime.packages_path() 4081
sublime.installed_packages_path() 4081
sublime.cache_path() 4081
If a plugin defines a module level function plugin_loaded(), this will be called when the API is ready to use. Plugins may also define plugin_unloaded(), to get notified just before the plugin is unloaded.
Threading
All API functions are thread-safe, however keep in mind that from the perspective of code running in an alternate thread, application state will be changing while the code is running.
Units and Coordinates
API functions that accept or return coordinates or dimensions do so using device-independent pixel (dip) values. While in some cases these will be equivalent to device pixels, this is often not the case. Per the CSS specification, minihtml treats the px unit as device-independent.
Types
This documentation generally refers to simply Python data types. Some type names are classes documented herein, however there are also a few custom type names that refer to construct with specific semantics:
location
a tuple of (str, str, (int, int)) that contains information about a location of a symbol. The first string is the absolute file path, the second is the file path relative to the project, the third element is a two-element tuple of the row and column.
point
an int that represents the offset from the beginning of the editor buffer. The View methods text_point() and rowcol() allow converting to and from this format.
value
any of the Python data types bool, int, float, str, list or dict.
dip
a float that represents a device-independent pixel.
vector
a tuple of (dip, dip) representing x and y coordinates.
CommandInputHandler
a subclass of either TextInputHandler or ListInputHandler.
