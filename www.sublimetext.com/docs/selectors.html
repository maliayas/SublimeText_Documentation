Selectors
Syntax definitions in Sublime Text use of scope names to provide metadata about tokens. Scopes are dotted strings, specified from least-to-most specific. For example, the if keyword in PHP could be specified via the scope name keyword.control.php. Tokens may have one or more scope names associated with them. Multiple scope names are associated with a token in an ordered manner.
This document covers selectors, which are the means to match scope names. Color schemes, key bindings, the API and even some settings all deal with selectors in one way or another. For information about standardized scope names, please see the Scope Naming documentation.
Basic Matching
Logical Operators
Basic Matching
A basic selector specifies one or more scope names, and is matched against a token‘s scope names starting with the left-most scope. For a selector to match a token‘s scope name, all of its labels must be present in the same order.
Scope Name
Selector
Matches
keyword.control.php
keyword
yes
keyword.control.php
keyword.control
yes
keyword.control.php
control
no, control != keyword
keyword.control.php
keyword.cont
no, cont != control
keyword.control.php
keyword.control.php.embedded
no, embedded could not be matched
When a selector has multiple scope names, each must match one of the token‘s scope names, in order.
Scope Name
Selector
Matches
source.php meta.block.php keyword.control.php
keyword
yes
source.php meta.block.php keyword.control.php
meta keyword
yes
source.php meta.block.php keyword.control.php
keyword meta
no, meta could not be matched after keyword
Logical Operators
In addition to matching scope names based of label prefix matches, selectors may also specify logical operators.
Logical OR
The logical OR operator is | or ,. If either the selector to the right or left of the operator is matched, the expression will be a match.
Scope Name
Selector
Matches
source.php meta.block.php
text | meta
yes
source.php
text, meta
no
Logical AND
The logical AND operator is &. It will require the selector to the right and left of the operator are both matched for the expression to be a match. This is different than a space between selectors, since that denoted hierarchy.
Scope Name
Selector
Matches
source.php meta.block.php keyword.control.php
keyword &amp; meta
yes
source.php meta.block.php
keyword &amp; meta
no
Logical NOT
The logical NOT operator is -. It will require the selector to the right to not match for the expression to be a match.
Scope Name
Selector
Matches
source.php meta.block.php
source - keyword
yes
source.php meta.block.php keyword.control.php
source - keyword
no
Grouping
When working with logical operators, parentheses may be used to group selectors.
Scope Name
Selector
Matches
source.php meta.block.php
source - (keyword | storage)
yes
source.php meta.block.php 
(source - source.php) | text
no
