Font Settings
Changing the font can be done via adding these lines to Preferences/Settings - User:
"font_face": "Courier New",
"font_size": 10
and then change as desired. The font will change when you save.
You can see other settings to change by browsing through Preferences/Settings - Default. There are many things that can be customized in Sublime Text.
