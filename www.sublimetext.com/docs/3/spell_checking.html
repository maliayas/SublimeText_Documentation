Spell Checking
Sublime Text uses Hunspell for its spell checking support. Additional dictionaries can be obtained from the OpenOffice.org Extension List
Dictionaries in a format ready to be used by Sublime Text are available at https://github.com/SublimeText/Dictionaries
Dictionaries
Sublime Text currently only supports UTF-8 encoded dictionaries. Most dictionaries are not encoded in UTF-8, instead using a more compact encoding for the language in question. To use a dictionary with Sublime Text, it'll first need to be converted into UTF-8.
Once you have a UTF-8 encoded dictionary, it can be installed by placing it in a package, for example, Packages/User, which you can access from the Preferences/Browse Packages menu item. Once the file is in place, you can select the dictionary from the View/Dictionary menu.
Settings
There are two settings that effect the spell checking: spell_check, which controls if spell checking is enabled, and dictionary, which gives the path to the dictionary file to use. For example:
"spell_check": true,
"dictionary": "Packages/Language - English/en_US.dic"
Added and ignored words are stored in the user settings under the added_words and ignored_words keys.
Commands
next_misspelling: Select the next misspelling
prev_misspelling: Select the previous misspelling
add_word: Adds the word given by the word argument to the add list
ignore_word: Adds the word given by the word argument to the ignore list
