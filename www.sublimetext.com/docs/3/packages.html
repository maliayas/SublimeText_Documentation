<h1>Packages</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Packages are a collection of resource files used by Sublime Text: plugins, syntax highlighting definitions, menus, snippets and more. Sublime Text ships with several packages, and more user created ones are available</p>

<p>Packages are stored in <tt>.sublime-package</tt> files, which are <tt>zip</tt> files with a different extension. Packages may also be stored unzipped within a directory, or a mix of the two: any loose files in the package directory will override files stored in the <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file.

<h3>Locations</h3>

<p>Zipped packages may be stored in:

<ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;executable_path&gt;/Packages</tt></li>
    <li><tt>&lt;data_path&gt;/Installed Packages</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Loose packages may be stored in:

<ul>
    <li><tt>&lt;data_path&gt;/Packages</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the package <tt>Python</tt> is stored in <tt>&lt;executable_path&gt;/Packages/Python.sublime-package</tt>, and any files in the <tt>&lt;data_path&gt;/Packages/Python</tt> directory will override those stored in the <tt>.sublime-package</tt> file.

<p>In general, <tt>&lt;executable_path&gt;/Packages</tt> is for packages that ship with Sublime Text, and <tt>&lt;data_path&gt;/Installed Packages</tt> is for packages installed by the user.

<h3>Special Packages</h3>

<p>There are two special packages: <tt>Default</tt> and <tt>User</tt>. <tt>Default</tt> is always ordered first, and <tt>User</tt> is always ordered last. Package ordering comes into effect when merging files between packages, for example <tt>Main.sublime-menu</tt>. Any package may contain a file called <tt>Main.sublime-menu</tt>, however this won't override the main menu, instead the files will be merged according to the order of the packages.

<p>Packages other than <tt>Default</tt> and <tt>User</tt> are ordered alphabetically.

<h3>Creating a New Package</h3>

<p>To create a new package, simply create a new directory under <tt>&lt;data_path&gt;/Installed Packages</tt>. You can access this directory from the <i>Preferences/Browse Packages</i> menu.

<h3>Overriding Files From a Zipped Package</h3>

<p>To override a file in an existing package, just create a file with the same name under the <tt>Packages/&lt;Package Name&gt;</tt> directory.</p>

<p>For example to override the file <tt>function.sublime-snippet</tt> in the <tt>Python.sublime-package</tt> package that ships with Sublime Text, create a directory called <tt>Python</tt> under the <tt>&lt;data_path&gt;/Packages</tt> directory, and place your <tt>function.sublime-snippet</tt> file there.
