<h1>Auto Complete</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Auto complete shows the completion popup as you type, so you can fill in long words by typing only a few characters. It's enabled by default for source code and HTML (but only after entering a &lt; character).

<h2>Disabling Auto Complete</h2>

<p>Auto complete can be disabled with the <tt>auto_complete</tt> setting. To disable it, add this line to <tt>Preferences/File Settings - User</tt>:

<pre class="code">
"auto_complete": false
</pre>

<p>If auto complete is disabled, the completion popup can be shown manually, or tab can be used to insert the highest ranking completion without showing the popup.

<h2>Manually Showing Completions</h2>

<p>Pressing <tt>Ctrl+Space</tt> will show the completion popup if it's not currently showing. If it is showing, it'll select the next item.

<h2>Commit on Tab</h2>

<p>By default, the selected item in the completion popup will be committed when enter is pressed. This can create ambiguity between committing the completion, and inserting a newline. By setting the <tt>auto_complete_commit_on_tab</tt> setting to true, enter will insert a newline, and tab will commit the current completion. There are other benefits, too: because Sublime Text knows there is no ambiguity, it will show a more curated list of completions, with the one you want more likely to be in first place.

<p>Enabling Commit on Tab is recommended, but it will take a short time to get used to.
