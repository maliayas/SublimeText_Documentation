        <p>
            Auto complete shows the completion popup as you type, so you can fill in long words by typing only a few characters. It's enabled by default for source code and HTML (but only after entering a &lt; character).
        </p>

        <h2>Disabling Auto Complete</h2>

        <p>
            Auto complete can be disabled with the <span class="setting">auto_complete</span> setting. To disable it, add this line to the right-hand pane of <span class="menu">Preferences &#9656; Settings</span>:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-js">"auto_complete": false</code></pre>

        <p>
            If auto complete is disabled, the completion popup can be shown manually, or tab can be used to insert the highest ranking completion without showing the popup.
        </p>

        <h2>Manually Showing Completions</h2>

        <p>
            Pressing <span class="key">ctrl+space</span> will show the completion popup if it's not currently showing. If it is showing, it'll select the next item.
        </p>

        <h2>Commit on Tab</h2>

        <p>
            By default, the selected item in the completion popup will be committed when enter is pressed. This can create ambiguity between committing the completion, and inserting a newline. By setting the <span class="setting">auto_complete_commit_on_tab</span> setting to <tt>true</tt>, enter will insert a newline, and tab will commit the current completion. There are other benefits, too: because Sublime Text knows there is no ambiguity, it will show a more curated list of completions, with the one you want more likely to be in first place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enabling Commit on Tab is recommended, but it will take a short time to get used to.
