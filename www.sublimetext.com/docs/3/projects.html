        <p>
            Projects in Sublime Text are made up of two files: the <span class="file">.sublime-project</span> file, which contains the project definition, and the <span class="file">.sublime-workspace</span> file, which contains user specific data, such as the open files and the modifications to each.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a general rule, the <span class="file">.sublime-project</span> file would be checked into version control, while the <span class="file">.sublime-workspace</span> file would not.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Format</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="file">.sublime-project</span> files are JSON, and support three top level sections: <span class="setting">folders</span>, for the included folders, <span class="setting">settings</span>, for file-setting overrides, and <span class="setting">build_systems</span>, for project specific build systems. An example:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-js">{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "src",
            "folder_exclude_patterns": ["backup"],
            "follow_symlinks": true
        },
        {
            "path": "docs",
            "name": "Documentation",
            "file_exclude_patterns": ["*.css"]
        }
    ],
    "settings":
    {
        "tab_size": 8
    },
    "build_systems":
    [
        {
            "name": "List",
            "shell_cmd": "ls -l"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Folders</h3>

        <p>
            Each folder must have a path, and may optionally have settings <span class="setting">file_exclude_patterns</span>, <span class="setting">file_include_patterns</span>, <span class="setting">folder_exclude_patterns</span>, <span class="setting">folder_include_patterns</span> and <span class="setting">follow_symlinks</span>. The path may be relative to the project directory, or a fully qualified path. Folders may also be given a <span class="setting">name</span> setting, to set how they're displayed on the side bar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Converted projects from earlier versions may have a <span class="setting">mount_points</span> entry under <span class="setting">folders</span>. If you wish to use the exclude patterns, you'll need to change to the above format.
        </p>

        <h3>Settings</h3>

        <p>
            <a href="settings.html">Settings</a> may be specified here using the <span class="setting">settings</span> key, and will override regular user settings. Note that they will not override syntax-specific settings.
        </p>

        <h3>Build Systems</h3>

        <p>
            <span class="setting">build_systems</span> specifices a list of inline <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/file_processing/build_systems.html">Build Systems</a> definitions. In addition to the regular build system settings, a <span class="setting">name</span> must be specified for each one. Build systems listed here will be available via the regular <span class="menu">Tools &#9656; Build Systems</span> menu.
