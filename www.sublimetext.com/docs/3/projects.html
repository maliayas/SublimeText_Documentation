Projects
Projects in Sublime Text are made up of two files: the sublime-project file, which contains the project definition, and the sublime-workspace file, which contains user specific data, such as the open files and the modifications to each.
As a general rule, the sublime-project file would be checked into version control, while the sublime-workspace file would not.
Project Format
sublime-project files are JSON, and support three top level sections: folders, for the included folders, settings, for file-setting overrides, and build_systems, for project specific build systems. An example:
{
"folders":
[
{
"path": "src",
"folder_exclude_patterns": ["backup"],
"follow_symlinks": true
},
{
"path": "docs",
"name": "Documentation",
"file_exclude_patterns": ["*.css"]
}
],
"settings":
{
"tab_size": 8
},
"build_systems":
[
{
"name": "List",
"shell_cmd": "ls -l"
}
]
}
Folders
Each folder must have a path, and may optionally have settings file_exclude_patterns, file_include_patterns, folder_exclude_patterns, folder_include_patterns and follow_symlinks. The path may be relative to the project directory, or a fully qualified path. Folders may also be given a name setting, to set how they're displayed on the side bar.
Converted projects from earlier versions may have a mount_points entry under folders. If you wish to use the exclude patterns, you'll need to change to the above format.
Settings
Settings may be specified here using the settings key, and will override regular user settings. Note that they will not override syntax specific settings.
Build Systems
Build Systems specifices an array of inline Build Systems definitions. In addition to the regular build system settings, a name must be specified for each one. Build Systems listed here will be available via the regular Tools/Build Systems menu.
