<h1>Projects</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Projects in Sublime Text are made up of two files: the sublime-project file, which contains the project definition, and the sublime-workspace file, which contains user specific data, such as the open files and the modifications to each.

<p>As a general rule, the sublime-project file would be checked into version control, while the sublime-workspace file would not.

<h2>Project Format</h2>

<p>sublime-project files are JSON, and support three top level sections: <span class="setting">folders</span>, for the included folders, <span class="setting">settings</span>, for file-setting overrides, and <span class="setting">build_systems</span>, for project specific build systems. An example:

<pre class="code">
{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "src",
            "folder_exclude_patterns": ["backup"],
            "follow_symlinks": true
        },
        {
            "path": "docs",
            "name": "Documentation",
            "file_exclude_patterns": ["*.css"]
        }
    ],
    "settings":
    {
        "tab_size": 8
    },
    "build_systems":
    [
        {
            "name": "List",
            "shell_cmd": "ls -l"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

<h3>Folders</h3>

<p>Each folder must have a path, and may optionally have settings file_exclude_patterns, file_include_patterns, folder_exclude_patterns, folder_include_patterns and follow_symlinks. The path may be relative to the project directory, or a fully qualified path. Folders may also be given a name setting, to set how they're displayed on the side bar.

<p>Converted projects from earlier versions may have a <span class="setting">mount_points</span> entry under <span class="setting">folders</span>. If you wish to use the exclude patterns, you'll need to change to the above format.

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p><a href="settings.html">Settings</a> may be specified here using the <span class="setting">settings</span> key, and will override regular user settings. Note that they will not override syntax specific settings.

<h3>Build Systems</h3>

<p>Build Systems specifices an array of inline <a href="http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/reference/build_systems.html">Build Systems</a> definitions. In addition to the regular build system settings, a <span class="setting">name</span> must be specified for each one. Build Systems listed here will be available via the regular <span class="menu">Tools/Build Systems</span> menu.
