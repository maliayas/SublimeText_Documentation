General Information
Example Plugins
Several pre-made plugins come with Sublime Text, you can find them in the Default package:
Packages/Default/delete_word.py Deletes a word to the left or right of the cursor
Packages/Default/duplicate_line.py Duplicates the current line
Packages/Default/exec.py Uses phantoms to display errors inline
Packages/Default/font.py Shows how to work with settings
Packages/Default/goto_line.py Prompts the user for input, then updates the selection
Packages/Default/mark.py Uses add_regions() to add an icon to the gutter
Packages/Default/show_scope_name.py Uses a popup to show the scope names at the caret
Packages/Default/trim_trailing_whitespace.py Modifies a buffer just before its saved
Plugin Lifecycle
At importing time, plugins may not call any API functions, with the exception of sublime.version(), sublime.platform(), sublime.architecture() and sublime.channel().
If a plugin defines a module level function plugin_loaded(), this will be called when the API is ready to use. Plugins may also define plugin_unloaded(), to get notified just before the plugin is unloaded.
Threading
All API functions are thread-safe, however keep in mind that from the perspective of code running in an alternate thread, application state will be changing while the code is running.
Types
This documentation generally refers to simply Python data types. Some type names are classes documented herein, however there are also a few custom type names that refer to construct with specific semantics:
location: a tuple of (str, str, (int, int)) that contains information about a location of a symbol. The first string is the absolute file path, the second is the file path relative to the project, the third element is a two-element tuple of the row and column.
point: an int that represents the offset from the beginning of the editor buffer. The View methods text_point() and rowcol() allow converting to and from this format.
value: any of the Python data types bool, int, float, str, list or dict.
vector: a tuple of (float, float) representing x and y coordinates.

int
Displays a yes / no / cancel question dialog to the user. If yes_title and/or no_title are provided, they will be used as the text on the corresponding buttons on some platforms. Returns sublime.DIALOG_YES, sublime.DIALOG_NO or sublime.DIALOG_CANCEL.

on_text_command(view, command_name, args)
(str, dict)

on_query_context(view, key, operator, operand, match_all)
bool or None
Called when determining to trigger a key binding with the given context key. If the plugin knows how to respond to the context, it should return either True of False. If the context is unknown, it should return None.
operator is one of:
sublime.OP_EQUAL: Is the value of the context equal to the operand?
sublime.OP_NOT_EQUAL: Is the value of the context not equal to the operand?
sublime.OP_REGEX_MATCH: Does the value of the context match the regex given in operand?
sublime.OP_NOT_REGEX_MATCH: Does the value of the context not match the regex given in operand?
sublime.OP_REGEX_CONTAINS: Does the value of the context contain a substring matching the regex given in operand?
sublime.OP_NOT_REGEX_CONTAINS: Does the value of the context not contain a substring matching the regex given in operand?
match_all should be used if the context relates to the selections: does every selection have to match (match_all == True), or is at least one matching enough (match_all == False)?
on_hover(view, point, hover_zone)
None

point is the closest point in the view to the mouse location. The mouse may not actually be located adjacent based on the value of

sublime.HOVER_TEXT: When the mouse is hovered over text.
sublime.HOVER_GUTTER: When the mouse is hovered over the gutter.
sublime.HOVER_MARGIN: When the mouse is hovered in whitespace to the right of a line.
