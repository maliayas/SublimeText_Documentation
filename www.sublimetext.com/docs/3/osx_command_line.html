<h1>OS X Command Line</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Sublime Text includes a command line tool, <tt>subl</tt>, to work with files on the command line. This can be used to open files and projects in Sublime Text, as well working as an <tt>EDITOR</tt> for unix tools, such as git and subversion.

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>The first task is to make a symlink to <tt>subl</tt>. Assuming you've placed Sublime Text in the Applications folder, and that you have a <tt>~/bin</tt> directory in your path, you can run:

<pre class="code">
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/bin/subl
</pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

Run <tt>subl --help</tt>,

<pre class="code">
Usage: subl [arguments] [files]         edit the given files
   or: subl [arguments] [directories]   open the given directories
   or: subl [arguments] -               edit stdin

Arguments:
  --project &lt;project&gt;: Load the given project
  --command &lt;command&gt;: Run the given command
  -n or --new-window:  Open a new window
  -a or --add:         Add folders to the current window
  -w or --wait:        Wait for the files to be closed before returning
  -b or --background:  Don't activate the application
  -s or --stay:        Keep the application activated after closing the file
  -h or --help:        Show help (this message) and exit
  -v or --version:     Show version and exit

--wait is implied if reading from stdin. Use --stay to not switch back
to the terminal when a file is closed (only relevant if waiting for a file).

Filenames may be given a :line or :line:column suffix to open at a specific
location.
</pre>

<h2>EDITOR</h2>

<p>To use Sublime Text as the editor for many commands that prompt for input, set your <tt>EDITOR</tt> environment variable:

<pre class="code">
export EDITOR='subl -w'
</pre>

<p>Specifying -w will cause the <tt>subl</tt> command to not exit until the file is closed.
