Git Integration
Added in:3.2
Sublime Text’s Git integration includes the following components:
Side Bar
Status Bar
Diff Markers
Sublime Merge Integration
Settings
Please note: the following documentation discusses the implementation of the Git integration as seen with the Default and Adaptive themes that are included with Sublime Text. Via the theme engine, it is possible for third-party themes to change the visual presentation of information, in which case the following documentation may not be accurate.
Side Bar
Files and folders displayed in the side bar will include a status badge along the right-hand edge, when modified. This includes files and folder in the Folders section of the side bar, along with files in the Open Files section. Ignored files and folders are de-emphasized in the side bar by reducing the opacity of the name.
When the mouse pauses over a status badge, a tool tip will be displayed indicating the status of the file, or in the case of a folder, the status of the contained files and folders.
Status Badge Key
The following table indicates the meaning of each badge. Please note that the color of the badges will be slightly different as they adapt to the closest hue in the active color scheme.
Untracked
Modified
Missing
Staged Addition
Staged Modification
Staged Deletion
Unmerged
When a folder contains files with multiple statuses, the badge most toward the end of the above list will override all others.
Status Bar
When the focussed file us containing within the working directory of a Git repository, the status bar will contain the name of the current branch, along with the number of files that are untracked, modified, staged or unmerged. The status bar element will look like:
master

Diff Markers
Sublime Text’s incremental_diff functionality ties in with the Git integration. By default, the incremental diff functionality tracks changes to the file since it was last saved, but it is also possible to diff against HEAD.
Here is an example of what the diff markers look like in action, using the Mariana color scheme:
27
28
A line that was added
29
30
A modified line
31
followed by another modified line
32
33
The line before this was deleted
34
Changing the setting git_diff_target to "head" will modify the diff markers to display a diff versus the version of the file at the Git repository HEAD, as opposed to the version of the file in the working directory.
See the incremental_diff documentation for more information and examples, including instructions for viewing inline diffs, navigating between hunks and reverting changes.
Sublime Merge Integration
The Git features available in Sublime Text were derived from work that went into our other product, Sublime Merge. Sublime Merge is a full-featured, blazing-fast Git client built upon the technologies from Sublime Text.
Since editing source code and prose requires different tools and workflows than managing a Git repository, we opted to integrate the most appropriate Git functionality into Sublime Text, but leave more advanced features in Sublime Merge. The following integration points make it easy to jump into the appropriate Git context:
Editor Context Menu
Open Git Repository…
File History…
Line History…
Blame File…
Side Bar Folder Context Menu
Open Git Repository…
Folder History…
Side Bar File Context Menu
Open Git Repository…
File History…
Folder History…
Blame File…
Command Palette
Sublime Merge: Open Repository
Sublime Merge: Folder History
Sublime Merge: File History
Sublime Merge: Blame File
Settings
"show_git_status" boolean
Enables Git integration.
Default: true
"git_diff_target" string
Controls the behavior of incremental diff for files in a Git repository. Valid values include:
"index" – diff against the Git index
"head" – diff against the file at HEAD
Default: "index"
