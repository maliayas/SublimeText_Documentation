This repo tracks the changes in
[Sublime Text documentation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/index.html).

The source is automatically fetched daily and if something new is found, it gets
committed automatically. Then I review it and push to this repo manually.

I create git tags for notesworthy commits, so you can subscribe to the
[releases](https://github.com/maliayas/SublimeText_Documentation/releases)
